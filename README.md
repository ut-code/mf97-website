# May Fest / Komaba Fest

This website is built using [Docusaurus 3](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Dependencies

this website requires these to run:

Node.js
npm

### Installation

```sh
npm ci
```

### Local Development

```
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```sh
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

For mf97, this repo is automatically deployed after updating the main branch.

### Reusing this repo

When reusing this repo, you need to edit ./docusaurus.config.js and ./src/pages/index.tsx.

Do NOT reuse the same remote repository, otherwise you will pollute previous generations.
